<h2>Description</h2>
My final project application for the Iron Yard Houston. Crumb is a single page web application designed for multiple household members, rental occupants, or anyone trying to keep up with their finances really. This application uses several frameworks/libraries such as:
<ul>
<li>Javascript(Duh)</li>
<li>Backbone.js</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Babel</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>Mongoose</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
</ul>

This application recieves information from the user indicating how much a certain member is responsible for during the current month. There can be several users per household and each is 'responsible' for their share of the expenses. Crumb provides an exceptional UI for every user and allows each person to visually see what they owe, and how much they have paid so far.
